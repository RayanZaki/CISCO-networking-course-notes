# 5.3: Network Communication Moedls:


## 5.2.2: The Protocol Stack :

- TCP/IP Model:
    - Network Access Layer: -> Ethernet
    - Internet Layer -> IPv4/IPv6
    - Transport Layer -> TCP
    - Application Layer -> HTTP

Sending a message requires a Communication Model, which is a set of networl protocols

### 5.2.3: The TCP/IP Model:

| Layer| Description|
|---|---|
|Application | Represents data to the user, plus encoding and dialog control |
|Transport | Supports communicatiopn between various devices across diverse networks |
|Internet | Determines the best path through the network |
|Network Access | Contro;ls the hardware devices and media that make up the network |

### 5.3.4 The OSI Reference Model:
= There are two basic types of models that we use to describe the functions that must occur in order for network communications to be successful: protocol models and reference models.

- **Protocol model**: just like TCP/IP

- **Reference Model**: This type of model describes the functions that must be completed at a particular layer, but does not specify exactly how a function should be accomplished. A reference model is not intended to provide a sufficient level of detail to define precisely how each protocol should work at each layer. The primary purpose of a reference model is to aid in clearer understanding of the functions and processes necessary for network communications


## Q & A:

### Question 1:

Which protocol is responsible for guaranteeing reliable delivery?

> TCP

## Question 2:
Which protocol is used by routers to forward messages?

> IP

## Question 3:

Which two layers of the OSI Model maps directly as the single network access layer in the TCP/IP model? (Choose two)

> Physical and Data Link

## Questiom 4:
IP addressing occurs at what layer of the OSI Model?

> Network
